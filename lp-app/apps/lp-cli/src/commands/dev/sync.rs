/// # Arguments
///
/// * `client` - Async client for communicating with server
/// * `change` - File change event to sync
/// * `project_uid` - Project UID for server-side path
/// * `local_fs` - Local filesystem for reading files (wrapped in Arc for Send + Sync)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(())` if the change was synced successfully
/// * `Err` if syncing failed
