# LightPlayer

LightPlayer is a tool for controlling visual effects on 32-bit RISC-V microcontrollers
(such as esp32c6) and various linux and desktop platforms.

GLSL shaders are used to define the visual effects, which are just-in-time (JIT) compiled to native
RISC-V
code on the target device.

The architecture is client-server, designed for headless operation on unattended devices,
controlled from a web UI, native app, or by api.

# Quick Start

To run the demo project:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Yona-Appletree/lp2025.git
cd lp2025

# Initialize your development environment
scripts/dev-init.sh

# Run the demo
just demo

# Run other examples
just demo -- <example-name>
```

# Development

To get started with development:

1. **Initialize the development environment:**

   ```bash
   scripts/dev-init.sh
   ```

   This will:
    - Check for required tools (Rust, Cargo, rustup, just)
    - Verify Rust version meets minimum requirements (1.90.0+)
    - Install the RISC-V target (`riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`) if needed
    - Set up git hooks (pre-commit hook runs `just check`)

2. **Required tools:**
    - Rust toolchain (1.90.0 or later) - [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
    - `just` - Task runner: `cargo install just` or via package manager

3. **Common development commands:**
    - `just fci` - Fix, check, build, and test the whole project. Do this before you submit a PR.
    - `just fci-app` - Fix, check, build, and test the application.
    - `just fci-glsl` - Fix, check, build, and test the GLSL compiler.

See `just --list` for all available commands.

# Repository Structure
