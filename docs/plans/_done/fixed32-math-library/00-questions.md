# Questions for Fixed32 Math Library Plan

## Current State

We have:
- `lp-builtins` crate with fixed32 implementations for `div`, `mul`, `sqrt`
- GLSL codegen that currently uses `get_math_libcall()` to call external functions like "sinf", "cosf", etc.
- Builtin registry system in `lp-glsl-compiler/src/backend/builtins/registry.rs` that supports both JIT and emulator modes
- Many failing builtin tests in `scripts/glsl-filetests.sh builtins`

## Goal

Refactor GLSL builtin math functions to call `lp-builtins` functions directly instead of using GLSL intrinsics. We need both float and fixed32 implementations, with float being simple wrappers around Rust std math functions.

## Scope

This plan focuses on **infrastructure** for builtin math functions. We will implement only `sin` and `cos` as examples to prove the infrastructure works. Future plans can add more functions using the same infrastructure.

## Questions

1. **Fixed-Point Math Library**: ✅ **DECIDED** - We'll port **libfixmath**'s implementation to Rust.
   - Uses Q16.16 format (perfect match for our fixed32)
   - Pure C, no dependencies, easy to port
   - Will use `FIXMATH_NO_CACHE` mode (no static memory)
   - See `00-library-analysis.md` for full analysis
   
   **Implementation details:**
   - ✅ **Which variant?** Accurate Taylor series (~2.1% accuracy)
   - ✅ **Operations**: Use Rust native operations for speed where possible:
     - Use `__lp_fixed32_mul` for fixed-point multiplies
     - Use Rust native division for compile-time constants (6, 120, 5040, etc.)
   - ✅ **Constants**: Use same constant values as libfixmath (e.g., `fix16_pi = 205887`) as `const` values
   - ✅ **Range reduction**: Use Rust's `%` operator for modulo operations

2. **Float Implementation Structure**: ✅ **DECIDED** - Use Cranelift native syscalls (TestCase external functions) for float trig functions.
   - Codegen continues to emit TestCase calls like "sinf", "cosf" (no change needed)
   - Fixed32 transform will convert these TestCase calls to `__lp_fixed32_*` calls
   - No need for `__lp_float_*` wrappers unless Cranelift doesn't support a function
   - Float and fixed32 are mutually exclusive per compilation (determined by target)

3. **Builtin Registry**: ✅ **DECIDED** - Add `Fixed32Sin` and `Fixed32Cos` to `BuiltinId` enum.
   - Follow same pattern as existing `Fixed32Div`, `Fixed32Mul`, `Fixed32Sqrt`
   - Add mapping table in fixed32 transform: `"sinf" -> "__lp_fixed32_sin"`, `"cosf" -> "__lp_fixed32_cos"`
   - Transform will detect TestCase calls to math functions and replace with `__lp_fixed32_*` calls

4. **Codegen Refactoring**: ✅ **DECIDED** - Stop using intrinsic GLSL calls, but don't remove the system yet.
   - `get_math_libcall()` already emits TestCase calls when `intrinsic-math` feature is disabled (current behavior)
   - Keep using `get_math_libcall()` - it will emit TestCase calls like "sinf", "cosf"
   - Fixed32 transform will convert these TestCase calls to `__lp_fixed32_*` calls via mapping table
   - Modify `convert_call()` in `converters/calls.rs` to detect TestCase calls to math functions and convert them
   - Don't remove intrinsic-math system code, just don't use it

5. **Test Structure**: ✅ **DECIDED** - Abstract sqrt test pattern into helper functions with tolerance parameter.
   - Use existing pattern from `sqrt.rs` as base (with `float_to_fixed` and `fixed_to_float` helpers)
   - Create helper functions that accept tolerance value as parameter
   - For trig functions (~2.1% accuracy), use ~2-3% tolerance

6. **Phase Structure**: ✅ **DECIDED** - Simplified structure:
   - 01-infrastructure: Helper functions, test utilities, registry updates
   - 02-implement-sin-cos: Port libfixmath, add to registry, add transform conversion
   - 03-testing: Testing and verification

7. **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ **DECIDED** - `scripts/glsl-filetests.sh builtins/trig-sin.glsl` must pass.
   - This proves the infrastructure works
   - Cos should work similarly once sin is working
   - Edge cases: Handle basic range reduction, defer complex NaN/Inf handling if not critical
