# Plan: Create Comprehensive Interface Block Tests

## Overview

Create a complete test suite for GLSL interface blocks in `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/interface-blocks/` following the flat naming convention with prefixes. These tests will comprehensively cover uniform blocks, buffer blocks (shader storage blocks), input/output blocks, block member declarations, instance names, and layout qualifiers. These tests are expected to fail initially, serving as a specification for implementing interface block support in the compiler.

## Directory Structure

Following the flat naming convention with prefixes, create tests in a single `interface-blocks/` directory:

└── edge-member-qualifiers.glsl    (member qualifier rules)
```

## Test File Patterns

Each test file should follow the pattern from other test suites:

```glsl
// test run
// target riscv32.fixed32

// ============================================================================
// Description of what is being tested
// ============================================================================

uniform Transform {
    mat4 modelViewMatrix;
    mat4 projectionMatrix;
};

float test_uniform_block_access() {
    return modelViewMatrix[0][0];
    // Should access uniform block member
}

// run: test_uniform_block_access() ~= expected_value
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Test Format**: Follow the exact format from other test suites with:

   - Header comments describing what's tested
   - Multiple test functions per file
   - `// run:` directives with expected results
   - Comments explaining expected behavior

2. **Coverage**: Ensure tests cover:

   - All block types (uniform, buffer, in, out)
   - Instance names and member access
   - Layout qualifiers
   - Memory qualifiers (for buffer blocks)
   - Member type restrictions
   - Shared blocks across shaders
   - Error cases

3. **Key Characteristics**:

   - Blocks group related variables
   - Instance names provide access path
   - Members cannot have initializers
   - Members cannot be opaque types
   - Structs cannot be nested in blocks
   - Shared blocks must match across shaders

4. **Expected Failures**: These tests are expected to fail initially, especially:

   - Block parsing and declaration
   - Instance name handling
   - Member access via instance
   - Layout qualifier handling
   - Memory qualifier handling
   - Shared block matching

5. **Reference Files**:
   - Pattern: `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/globals/declare-uniform.glsl`
   - Pattern: `lightplayer/crates/lp-glsl-filetests/filetests/structs/access-scalar.glsl`

## Files to Create

Create 30 test files in the `interface-blocks/` directory structure above, with each file containing 3-10 test functions following the established pattern. All files use the prefix naming convention:

- `uniform-*` for uniform blocks
- `buffer-*` for buffer blocks
- `input-*` for input blocks
- `output-*` for output blocks
- `member-*` for member-related tests
- `instance-*` for instance name tests
- `shared-*` for shared block tests
- `edge-*` for edge cases

## GLSL Spec References

- **variables.adoc**: Interface Blocks (lines 2727-3029)
- Key sections:
  - Block declaration syntax
  - Block types (uniform, buffer, in, out)
  - Instance names
  - Member declarations
  - Layout qualifiers on blocks
  - Memory qualifiers on buffer blocks
